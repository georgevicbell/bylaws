This is a copy of the City of Toronto's bylaws, feel free to create issues and fixes. 

Hopefully this will encourage more discussiona and understanding of Toronto's ByLaws.

The bylaws are normally in pdf format, so the pdf folder is the easiest way to read and browse the pdfs.

It is easier to link to sections of the bylaws in the txt file section. 

You can also make PRs, which describe the changes you are proposing.

This repo will be occasionally updated as changes are made on the cities website, we won't be merging any PR's, they are only for tracking.
