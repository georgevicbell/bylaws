(a) 

In the case of a residential building or structure, or the residential uses in a

(b) 

In the case of a non-residential building or structure, or the non-residential 
uses in a mixed-use building or structure, which is being redeveloped for

the building or structure that has been or will be demolished or converted to 
another use has been legally established pursuant to all applicable zoning by-laws

A. 

Development charges applicable to a development shall be payable and collected on the 
date a building permit is issued in respect of the building or structure for which the owner 
has made a building permit application, unless the development charge is to be paid at a 
different time under Sections 26 or 26.1 of the Act, or is to be paid or has been paid at a

C. 

The amount of development charges payable in respect of a development shall be 
determined by applying the development charge rates in effect on the date that a building 
permit is issued in respect of the building or structure for which the owner has made a 
building permit application, unless the applicable development charge rates are to be 
determined under Section 26.2 of the Act or on a different date under an agreement 
pursuant to Section 27 of the Act; 

Despite § 415-5B, if two or more of the actions described in § 415-5A occur at different

D.  Where the only outstanding applicable law requirement to allow the issuance of a 

building permit is the payment of development charges and the required development 
charge payment has been made to the City, and there has been a change in the 
development charge rates between the date of such payment and the date the building 
permit is issued, then for the purposes of the calculation in § 415-8A and 415-8B the 
development charge rates in effect on the date that such payment was received by the 
City shall be applied; 

E. 

F. 

Despite the provisions of this article, Council may enter into an agreement with any 
person who is required to pay a development charge providing for all or any part of the 
development charge to be paid before or after it would otherwise be payable; 

Where under a written agreement entered into by a Former Municipality which required 
payments pursuant to a by-law of the Former Municipality enacted under the 
Development Charges Act, R.S.O. 1990, unless the agreement provides otherwise, any 
payment of the development charge under the agreement shall be a pro rata credit against 
the outstanding balance of the development charge applicable to the development which 
shall be calculated on a pro rata basis, payable and collected as of the date a building 
permit is issued, in respect of the building or structure for the use to which the 
development charge applies, but the amount of any such credit shall not exceed, in total, 
the amount of the development charge otherwise payable;

the provision of work pursuant to the Development Charges Act, R.S.O. 1990, relating to 
a service set out in § 415-2, unless the agreement provides otherwise, the provision of 
services under the agreement shall be a pro rata credit equal to the reasonable cost to the 
owner of providing the work or service, against the balance of the development charge 
applicable to the development which shall be calculated on a pro rata basis, payable and 
collected as of the date a building permit is issued, in respect of the building or structure 
for the use to which the development charge applies, but the amount of any such credit 
shall not exceed the total amount of the development charge payable with respect to that

TORONTO MUNICIPAL CODE 
CHAPTER 415, DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 

The amount of the development charge payable upon the issuance of a building permit 
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the applicable charge by service, as set out on 
Schedules A-1 to A-3, inclusive, and B-1 and B-2 at the end of this chapter, for each 
service for which payment has previously been made under the terms of a subdivision 
agreement entered into with the City pursuant to section 51 of the Planning Act; 

Where a development charge or any part of it remains unpaid at any time after it is 
payable, the amount unpaid shall be added to the tax roll and shall be collected in the 
same manner as taxes; 

Where a development charge has been paid in respect of a residential building or 
structure, and the development is subsequently revised within the same building envelope 
but with a different distribution of unit types such that a revised building permit and new 
calculation of development charges payable is required, the calculation of the amount of 
development charges payable will be made in respect of such revised building permit as 
follows: 

(1)  Where there is an increase in the number of any type of dwelling unit or dwelling 

room, the development charges payable will be calculated by multiplying the 
number of such dwelling units or dwelling rooms so increased by the 
development charge rate then in effect according to the type of dwelling unit or 
room; and 

(2)  Where there is a decrease in the number of any type of dwelling unit or dwelling 
room, the development charges payable will be reduced by multiplying the 
number of such dwelling units or dwelling rooms so reduced by the development 
charge rate that was in effect and collected for such unit type upon issuance of the 
initial building permit for the development; 

provided that in no case shall any refund be provided in an amount greater than the 
amount of development charges paid upon issuance of such initial building permit; 

K.  Where a development charge has been paid in respect of a non-residential building or 

structure, and the development is subsequently revised within the same building envelope 
but such that a revised building permit and new calculation of development charges 
payable is required, the calculation of the amount of development charges payable will be 
made in respect of such revised building permit as follows: 

(1)  Where there is an increase in the amount of non-residential gross floor area, the 

development charges payable will be calculated by multiplying the amount of 
gross floor area so increased by the development charge rate then in effect; and 

(2)  Where there is a decrease in the amount of non-residential gross floor area, the 

development charges payable will be reduced by multiplying the amount of gross 
floor area so reduced by the development charge rate that was in effect and 
collected  upon issuance of the initial building permit for the development, 

415-19 

August 15, 2022 

 
TORONTO MUNICIPAL CODE 
CHAPTER 415, DEVELOPMENT OF LAND 

provided that in no case shall any refund be provided in an amount greater than the 
amount of development charges paid upon issuance of such initial building permit; 

L. 

Where a development charge has been paid in respect of an application for a building 
permit prior to the date on which the development charge is payable and the building 
permit, for whatever reason, is not issued until a later date, such earlier payment does not 
constitute full payment of all development charges payable, and on the date of actual 
building permit issuance the amount of development charges payable will be calculated 
to reflect any change in development charge rates since the date of the original payment, 
and the difference in development charges payable, if any, shall be paid prior to issuance 
of the building permit; and 

M.  Where an owner makes a subsequent building permit application for a building or 

structure that is built, in whole or in part, above, on top of or attached to another existing 
building or structure, including a podium or parking structure whether above or below 
grade, development charges are due and payable upon issuance of the building permit for 
such subsequent building or structure, and not at the time of issuance of the building 
permit for the underlying or supporting existing building or structure. 

§ 415-9. Payment by services. 

A. 

Despite the provisions of this article, Council may by prior written agreement permit an 
owner to provide services in lieu of the payment for all or any portion of a development 
charge. Where a prior written agreement has been entered into, the City shall give the 
owner who performed the work a credit towards the development charge in accordance 
with the agreement and subject to the requirements of the Act, but the credit shall not 
exceed the total amount of the development charge payable with respect to that service 
and calculated in accordance with the charge by service set out in Schedules A-1 to A-3, 
inclusive, and B-1 and B-2 at the end of this chapter; and 

B. 

Nothing in this article prevents Council from requiring, as a condition of any approval 
given under the Planning Act, that the owner, at the owner's expense, install such local 
services and local connections as Council may require and are related to the development. 

§ 415-10. Front ending agreements. 

Council may enter into front ending agreements with an owner or owners of land in accordance 
with section 44 of the Act. 

§ 415-11. Indexing. 

A. 

The development charges set out in Schedules A-1 to A-3, inclusive, and Schedules B-1, 
B-2 and C at the end of this chapter shall be adjusted by the City without amendment to 
this article on May 1, 2023, in accordance with the most recent annual change in the 
Statistics Canada Quarterly Construction Price Statistics, and annually thereafter on 
May 1 of each subsequent year; and

The phasing in of the development charge calculated, payable and collected under this article 
shall be as shown on Schedules A-1 to A-3, inclusive, and B-1 and B-2 at the end of this chapter. 

§ 415-13. Term of article. 

This article shall continue in full force and effect for a term of five years from the date on which 
it comes into force, unless repealed on an earlier date. 

§ 415-14. Refunds. 

A.  Where a development charge has been paid on the issuance of a building permit and the 
building permit is subsequently cancelled or revoked, for the purposes of this article the 
building permit shall be deemed never to have been issued, and the amount of the 
development charges paid shall be refunded to the payor without interest; and 

B.  Where a development charge has been paid on the issuance of a building permit, and it is 
subsequently determined by the City that there was an error in the calculation of the 
amount of such payment such that there was an overpayment of development charges, the 
Chief Financial Officer, in consultation with the City Solicitor, is authorized to refund to 
the payor the amount of such overpayment without interest, such refund to be paid from 
the applicable development charge reserve fund or funds. 

§ 415-14.1. Additional development charges. 

Additional development charges may be imposed under other by-laws.
