Provides funding to:  
(a) Preserve or replace licensed spaces available for use 

by subsidized families when these spaces are 
threatened by loss of tenure in schools/other 
community-based locations or funding decisions 
should be guided by the following considerations: 
1.  School-age child care spaces should be 

relocated to schools or recreational facilities 
and operate out of predominantly shared space; 
2.  Relocation retrofit is preferable to new capital 

development; 

3.  Capital development should be pursued only 

after less costly options have been pursued 
without success; 

4.  Funding need not faithfully replicate the lost 

services; however, replacement service must be 
efficiently configured and support the 
objectives of the Children's Services Service 
Plan; 

5.  Preservation of service in high-needs areas and 

under-served areas is a priority; and 
6.  Relocation into schools or multiservice 

facilities if preferred. 

(b) Develop new services that meet one or more of the 

following objectives: 
1. 

Increase the supply of infant spaces in under-
served areas. 
Increase the supply of licensed spaces in under-
served areas. 
Increase the supply of spaces to high-needs
