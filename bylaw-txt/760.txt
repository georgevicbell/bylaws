whom notice of an intention to take the land under statutory authority was given, or that

acquired the leasehold interest if the value of that consideration was determined under 
Subsection D of the definition of "value of the consideration"5 and tax was computed and paid

with respect to the value of that consideration so determined, but the reduction shall not exceed 
the value of the consideration for the conveyance of the freehold interest.

§ 760-18. Multiple conveyances. 

Where land is conveyed by more than one conveyance and the Chief Financial Officer and

§ 760-81. Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer not bound by information. 

The Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer is not bound by any information delivered by or on

person with whom the transferor is not dealing at arm's length, the transferor and 
transferee are jointly and severally liable to pay under this chapter the amount determined 
under Subsection C. 

For the purpose of Subsection A, persons shall be deemed not to deal with each other at 
arm's length if, by reason of subsections 251(1) to (6) of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985 
(5th Supp.), c. 1, they are related to each other for the purposes of that Act.

time of the conveyance, exceeds the fair market value, at the time of the
