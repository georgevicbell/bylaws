Borough of East York, the former City of Etobicoke, the former City of North York, the former City of Scarborough, the former City of 
Toronto and the former City of York; and that policy, further modified by the adoption of Administration Committee Report No. 7, 
Clause No. 1, as amended, by Council at its meeting of June 18, 19 and 20, 2002, is replaced by the provisions of this by-law. Section 4 of 
this by-law stated that, despite sections 2 and 3 of this by-law, the provisions former City of Toronto By-law 51-71, as amended, and the 
fair wage policy of the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto shall remain in full force and effect for the purposes of any review, 
actions, claims, proceedings, etc., until that review, action, claim, proceeding, etc., has been concluded to the full extent permitted by law; 
and sections 2 and 3 of this by-law shall not affect any offence committed against, any penalty incurred in respect to, nor any 
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy under former City of Toronto By-law 51-71 and the fair wage policy of the former 
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. Section 5 of this by-law stated that any investigation or legal proceeding commenced under or in 
respect of former City of Toronto By-law 51-71 and the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto policy prior to the in-force date of 
this by-law shall be taken up and continued in conformity with By-law 51-71 and the former Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto 
policy. Finally, Section 6 stated that this by-law comes into force on August 1, 2003, except that certain portions of the Fair Wage 
Schedule may come into force at a later date, as indicated in the Schedule.
