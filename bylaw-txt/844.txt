ARTICLE VII 
Rates and Rebates 

§ 844-28. Residential curbside collection fees. 

A.  An owner of a residential property who receives residential curbside collection shall pay 

the applicable residential curbside collection fees based on the quantity and size of garbage 
bins used by the residential property as set out in Schedule 1 of Appendix A of Chapter 
441, Fees and Charges. 

B.  For the first year during which this section is in force, the residential curbside collection 

fees will be prorated on a daily basis. 

C.  When the owner of a residential property who receives residential curbside collection 

requests a garbage bin exchange under § 844-15N, requests an additional garbage bin, or 
when there is a change in ownership of a residential property, the residential curbside 
collection fees under Subsection A will be prorated on a daily basis. 

D.  Despite Subsection A, if an owner of a residential property who receives residential 

curbside collection uses a specialized in-home compactor to reduce its garbage volume 
and, as a result, uses a smaller-sized garbage bin, the General Manager reserves the right to 
increase the residential curbside collection fees for the residential property to a larger-sized 
garbage bin to compensate for the compaction, as the residential curbside collection fees 
are based on the collection of un-compacted garbage. 

E.  The City will bill each owner of a residential property, who receives residential curbside 
collection, the residential curbside collection fee on the utility bill issued pursuant to 
Article III of Chapter 849, Water and Sewage Services and Utility Bill.

Schedule 1 of Appendix A of Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, up to 1.917 cubic yards of

B.  An owner of a multi-residential curbside property who receives residential curbside 
collection and sets out more than 1.917 cubic yards per dwelling unit per year of un-

C.  An owner of a multi-residential curbside property who receives residential curbside 

collection and sets out more than 0.9585 cubic yards per dwelling unit per year of 
compacted garbage shall pay the excess collection fee for compacted garbage as set out in 
Schedule 1 of Appendix A of Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, for each additional cubic 
yard of compacted garbage set out. 

D.  The City shall use the following formula to determine the amount of excess un-compacted 
garbage or compacted garbage collected from an owner of a multi-residential curbside 
property: 

EG = AVC – ABV 
Where: 

AVC is the annual volume collected determined by the following formula: 

AVC = [EB X ECY] X FC 

Where: 

EB = number of extra large garbage bins at a multi-residential 

curbside property 

 ECY = cubic yard size of the extra large garbage bin 

FC = frequency of collection per year, either biweekly (26 times per 

year), weekly (52 times per year) or twice a week (104 times 
per year) 

ABV is the annual base volume for the multi-residential curbside property determined 
by the following formula: 

ABV = [# of dwelling units in the multi-residential curbside property X BV] 

Where: 

BV = Base volume of 1.917 for un-compacted garbage or 

0.9585 for compacted garbage 

E.  Despite Subsection A, if the owner of a multi-residential curbside property who receives 

residential curbside collection garbage is compacting their garbage more densely than a 2:1 
compaction ratio and, as a result, uses fewer garbage containers, the General Manager 
reserves the right to increase the residential curbside collection fees for the building to 
compensate for the compaction.

fees shall be prorated on a daily basis.
