in accordance with the provisions of this article set out in § 849-14.7 to § 849-14.17, inclusive. 

§ 849-14.8. Administration of the home dialysis water rebate. 

[Added 2018-07-27 by By-law 1259-2018] 

The home dialysis water rebate program will be administered by the City's Revenue Services 
Division under the jurisdiction of the Controller. The Controller is authorized to establish and 
implement additional administrative program details and eligibility criteria of the home dialysis

§ 849-14.9. Home dialysis water rebate. 

[Added 2018-07-27 by By-law 1259-2018] 

Where a person has received written notification of approval from the City authorizing the 
person's entitlement to receive the home dialysis water rebate, the City will provide the home 
dialysis water rebate to the person in accordance with the provisions set out in § 849-14.7 to

receives a utility bill issued in their name, as those terms are defined under this Chapter, 

849-17 

June 18, 2023 

 
TORONTO MUNICIPAL CODE 
CHAPTER 849, WATER AND SEWAGE SERVICES AND UTILITY BILL 

for a residential property, equipped with a meter under the City's Water Meter Program, 
and at which residential property the person resides. In the case of a person who is an 
owner, any change in ownership of the residential property, which is the subject of the 
home dialysis water rebate application, will automatically terminate the person's 
entitlement, if any, to receive the home dialysis water rebate. In this circumstance, to 
continue to be eligible for the home dialysis water rebate, the person will be required to 
submit a new application for the rebate and meet the eligibility conditions of the home 
dialysis water rebate program at that time. In the case of a person who is a designated 
tenant, any change in the tenancy of the residential property, which is the subject of the 
home dialysis water rebate application, will automatically terminate the person's 
entitlement, if any, to receive the home dialysis water rebate. In this circumstance, to 
continue to be eligible for the home dialysis water rebate, the person will be required to 
submit a new application for the rebate and meet the eligibility conditions of the home 
dialysis water rebate program at that time. If, however, the ownership of the residential 
property has changed but the designated tenant continues to reside at the residential 
property, a new utility bill designate mailing request is required to be submitted to the 
City's Revenue Services Division, to the satisfaction of the Controller, in the proper form 
and no later than 45 days prior to the end of the current billing period to continue 
eligibility, failing which eligibility will be suspended until the request is received by the 
Controller in the proper form, but a new application for the rebate program is not 
required. 

The person referenced in Subsection B, or the person's dependent or family member who 
resides with the person at the residential property, is receiving and must continue to 
receive home dialysis treatment as a necessary and prescribed medical treatment at the 
residential property for which the utility account is issued. The home dialysis water 
rebate will only be considered for the duration of the home dialysis treatment period and 
will not be available to the person, or provided by the City, if the home dialysis treatment 
ends. The person must notify in writing the City's Revenue Services Division 
immediately of any termination of the home dialysis treatment. 

Neither the person, nor the person's dependent or family member, as referenced in 
Subsection C is receiving a home hemodialysis utility grant through the Ontario Renal 
Network, or its successor, or any other agency, or any other financial relief funding for 
water from any source related in any way to the home dialysis treatment at the residential 
property. The person will provide such information as the City may require in order for 
the City to determine in its sole discretion whether the person, or the person's dependent

§ 849-14.12. Basis for and calculation of the home dialysis water rebate and maximum 

rebate amount. 

[Added 2018-07-27 by By-law 1259-2018] 

A. 

The amount of the home dialysis water rebate, if any, will be equal to the applicable 
water rates charged to the owner or designated tenant named in the utility bill for the 
residential property for the actual portion of water consumption directly attributable to 
the home dialysis treatment during the applicable billing period, calculated in accordance 
with Subsection B. The City will use data from the automated meter reading system, in 
correlation with the information provided in the application for the home dialysis water 
rebate, including information related to the type of dialysis equipment utilized and the 
frequency of treatments received, and such other information as the Controller may 
consider relevant in the circumstances, in order to determine the water consumption for 
the residential property directly attributable to the home dialysis treatment. 

B. 

The home dialysis rebate payable, if any, under the home dialysis rebate program will be 
calculated by the Controller, in his or her sole discretion, for each applicable utility 
billing period as follows: 

- 

Historical recorded daily 
average water 
consumption for similar 
period (not receiving 
home dialysis) 

Water 
consumption 
to be rebated  

= 

Current recorded 
water consumption 
for the billing period 
minus any additional 
water consumption 
not considered 
directly attributable 
to the home dialysis 
treatment (while 
receiving home 
dialysis treatment)  

The water consumption to be rebated is then multiplied by the applicable water rate to 
establish the dollar value of the rebate payable, if any, for the applicable utility billing

An eligible person, as defined in § 849-14.10, who has made a successful application for the 
home dialysis water rebate under § 849-14.11 will not be entitled to the home dialysis water 
rebate until such time as the home dialysis water rebate has been approved by the City in 
accordance with § 849-14.9.  However, once approved, the home dialysis water rebate will be

water/sewer portion of the eligible person's utility bill for the residential property which is the 
subject of the application under § 849-14.11, unless the rebate is otherwise specifically requested 
by the eligible person to be in the form of a cheque issued to the eligible person. 

§ 849-14.15. False statements. 

[Added 2018-07-27 by By-law 1259-2018] 

Any false or deceptive statement by a person in an application or related documentation under 
the home dialysis water rebate program, or otherwise false pretense, as determined by the 
Controller in his or her sole discretion, will render the person ineligible for the home dialysis 
water rebate and require repayment by the person to the City of any rebate amount paid or 
credited to the utility bill.  In these circumstances, the City will be entitled to add the amount of 
the rebate paid or credited back onto the person's utility bill from the date that the home dialysis 
rebate was originally made. 

§ 849-14.16. City's right to cancel. 

[Added 2018-07-27 by By-law 1259-2018]

satisfied that the customer has met all eligibility requirements. 

(4)  Notwithstanding Subsection C(3) above, in the event that a customer has three 
instances of non-compliance within the same billing year, whether the non-
compliance is evidenced by the issuance of written notices of violation or the 
customer's failure to have complied with any required dates for the submission and 
delivery to the City of a document as set by the Sewers By-law, or any combination 
of both, the customer shall cease, effective from the date of the third instance of non-

conservation plan progress report will not be approved and the customer will cease to 
be eligible to receive the Block 2 Rate effective July 1st of the year the progress 
report was submitted or to be submitted for approval. 

(6)  Notwithstanding Subsection D(5), where the customer subsequently implements the 
approved water conservation plan and submits a water conservation progress report 
demonstrating that implementation, all to the satisfaction of the General Manager, 
Toronto Water, the customer will be eligible to receive the Block 2 Rate effective the 
date that the approved water conservation plan progress report was received by the 
General Manager, Toronto Water, provided that all other eligibility requirements have 
been met.

A.  Where the CFO determines that a meter is defective, that a remote read out unit is 

inaccurately recording the amount of water consumed at a property, that a meter's dial 
capacity coding is incorrect, or that a water account is incorrect as a result of any other 
error on the part of the City or City-owned equipment, the CFO may adjust the water

event shall an owner be entitled to an adjustment under this section more than once with 
respect to the same property. 

C.

including, but not limited to, meters that have been unsealed or have an unsealed bypass 
valve, meters that have not been installed, meters that have been removed, meters that have 
been bypassed temporarily or permanently, or meters that have been tampered with in any 
way, the CFO shall be entitled to adjust the water account and include all water fees that 
ought to have been payable in respect of the property as determined in accordance with 
§ 849-31E.  

D.  Where the CFO determines that a solid waste management account is incorrect as the result 
of any error on the part of the City or as a result of City-owned equipment, change in 
ownership of the property, an incorrect garbage bin size, or application of an incorrect 
billing volumes/number of tips for multi-residential property has been applied, the CFO 
may adjust the solid waste management account, specific to the applicable billing period, in 
order to ensure that the appropriate charges and the solid waste management fees are paid 
in respect of the property and any such adjustments will be reflected on the next utility bill.

In the event there is a discrepancy between the reading obtained from the register on a 
meter and the reading obtained from the remote read out unit in respect of that meter, the 
amount obtained from the reading of register on the meter shall be deemed to be the correct 
reading. 

D.  The CFO shall be entitled to issue utility bills based on actual water consumption at a 

property determined by meter or remote read out readings, or based on an estimated 
reading, calculated in accordance with the daily average water consumption at a property 
during a similar period of time, as determined by the CFO. [Amended 2008-05-27 by By-
law 506-2008126] 

E.  Despite § 849-31D, in the event the CFO determines that a meter is defective, that a meter 
is not registering the correct amount of water used, that a meter is unsealed or has an 
unsealed bypass valve, that a meter has not been installed, or that a meter has been 
removed, the CFO shall be entitled to estimate the water consumption at a property based 
on either the average consumption as shown by subsequent readings from a properly 
functioning meter accurately registering the water consumed at the property, or based on

accurately registering meter at such premises during a similar time period. 

F.  Despite § 849-31D, in the event the Controller determines that a customer is subject to an 
unexplained consumption increase, the Controller may adjust the customer's water account 
for the subject billing period to an amount based on the historical average consumption for 
the same or a similar property during a similar period of time, provided that: [Added 2012-

uncontrollable consumption increase and payment of the uncontrollable consumption 
increase would result in an undue financial hardship for the customer, the Controller may 
adjust the customer's water account for the subject billing period to an amount based on the 
historical average consumption for the same or a similar property during a similar period of 
time, provided that: [Added 2012-07-13 by By-law 1005-2012; amended by 2019-12-18

I. 

The Controller may consider and, where appropriate, allow a one-time adjustment under 
§ 849-31F or § 849-31G for a billing period within the two-year period preceding the 
enactment of this by-law provided that: [Added 2012-07-13 by By-law 1005-2012] 

(a)

there is sufficient information available, in the Controller's determination, for the 
Controller to determine that the criteria for a one-time adjustment under § 
849-31F or § 849-31G, as the case may be, has been met. 

J.  Where a utility bill has not been issued for a period in excess of one year in respect of a 
property which does not have a meter in contravention of § 849-29, the CFO may add to 
the water account water fees from the date of the last utility bill issued in respect of the 
property, or from the commencement of the occupancy of the property, based on 
consumption calculated in accordance with § 849-31E. [Amended 2008-05-27 by By-law

sign and return, within 14 days of receipt, the flat rate self-rating form provided by the 
CFO in respect of his or her property. 

C.  Every owner or his or her agent shall notify the CFO and provide him or her with

entitled to not resume the supply of water to the property until such time as the arrears are 
paid to the City or an arrangement to repay the arrears, satisfactory to the CFO, has been

The CFO shall have due regard to Municipal Code Chapter 835, Discontinuance of Vital 
Services, before he or she shuts off the supply of water to a property. 

§ 849-34.1. Collection of water arrears: apportionment and adding to the tax roll 

condominiums. 

[Added 2012-10-04 by By-law 1253-2012] 

A. 

This section applies to bulk metered water accounts of condominium corporations. 

B.  Where any water fees remain unpaid by a condominium corporation 28 calendar days 
after they are due to be paid, the CFO may send a notice by prepaid mail to each unit 
owner within that condominium corporation advising the respective unit owners that, 
unless the amount of water fees owing as specified in the notice is paid in full within 
30 calendar days of the notice date, the City may apportion among the then individual 
unit owners of the condominium corporation those water fees remaining in arrears 
together with any collection charges as may be approved by the City from time to time 
and transfer such respective amounts to the real property tax rolls for each respective 
unit. 

C. 

If the amount required is not paid in the time set out in subsection B, the CFO may 
apportion among the then individual unit owners of the condominium corporation those 
water fees remaining in arrears together with any collection charges as may be approved 
by the City from time to time and transfer such respective amounts to the real property 
tax rolls for each respective unit. For clarity, the apportionment of water fees owing 
amongst each unit owner within a condominium corporation shall be done on a pro-rata 
basis equal to the proportions, expressed in percentages allocated to the units, in which 
the owners are to contribute to the common expenses as set out in the declaration of the 
condominium corporation. 

D. 

Despite Subsections B and C, in the case of a unit supplied directly with water metered 
by the City, authority is delegated to the Controller to exempt owners of such units within 
the condominium corporation, in whole or in part, from having a proportionate share of 
water arrears apportioned to them.
