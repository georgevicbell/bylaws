If the City Clerk determines that rebate applications may be submitted by mail,

application, but the contributor claims that their application was mailed in time, 
the contributor may certify this to the City Clerk, in the form established by the 
City Clerk. On receipt of the certification, the City Clerk is authorized to process 
that rebate application in accordance with this Schedule; and 

A contributor must claim their rebate through the Rebate System on or before

Total contributions of $25 or less receive no rebate.

less, the maximum rebate that will be paid to the contributor is 75 per cent 
of that total. 

If the total of the contributor's contributions to all candidates is more than 
$300 but not more than $1,000, the maximum rebate that will be paid to 
the contributor is $225 plus 50 per cent of the difference between that total 
and $300. 

If the total of the contributor's contributions to all candidates is more than 
$1,000, the maximum rebate that will be paid to the contributor is the 
lesser of: 

(a) 

$575 plus 33⅓ per cent of the difference between the total and 
$1,000; or
