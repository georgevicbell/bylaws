A.  Every person who contravenes any provision with the exception of §§ 903-4A, 903-4B, 903-

to an administrative penalty of not less than $300.00 for each contravention. 

C.  Unless at the time of the contravention the vehicle was in the possession of another person

contravention of §§ 903-4A, 903-4B, 903-7A, 903-8A or 903-9, the vehicle owner shall, upon
