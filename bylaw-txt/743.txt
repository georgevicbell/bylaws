TORONTO MUNICIPAL CODE 
CHAPTER 743, STREETS AND SIDEWALKS, USE OF 

After completing any street work, the applicant shall restore and/or leave the street in 
substantially the same condition in which it was before such street work was undertaken 
by the applicant, free from nuisance and to the satisfaction of the General Manager. If the 
applicant fails to repair and restore any street to the satisfaction of the General Manager 
within 48 hours of being notified by the City, the City may undertake such repairs and 
charge all costs owing to the applicant, and may draw on any financial security or 
deposits submitted by the applicant. 

The applicant shall maintain the equipment in good and proper repair and in a condition 
satisfactory to the General Manager. 

Should the General Manager deem it necessary for the equipment to be removed or 
altered in an emergency, including repairs or maintenance to equipment owned or 
operated by the City or any agency, board or commission of the City, the General 
Manager, without notice to the applicant, may alter or remove, or cause to be altered or 
removed, the equipment and, subject to the requirements of any applicable law or 
existing agreement, the cost of such alteration or removal of the equipment shall be borne 
by the applicant. 

Should the General Manager deem it necessary for the equipment to be removed or 
altered for any municipal purpose, including installation or alteration of new or existing 
plant by any agency, board or commission, the General Manager may upon three months 
notice in writing to the applicant, alter or remove, or cause to be altered or removed, the

subject to the requirements of any applicable law or existing agreement, the cost of such 
alteration or removal of the equipment shall be borne by the applicant.

work following notice to the applicant provided by the General Manager. 

The applicant shall be at all times responsible for all aspects of the street work, including 
the cost of such street work. 

The applicant shall notify the City promptly of any damage caused by the applicant in 
connection with its street work. 

The City has made no representations or warranties as to the state of repair of the streets 
or the suitability of the streets for any business, activity or purpose whatsoever, and the 
applicant hereby agrees to take the streets on an "as is" basis for the purpose of the 
carrying out of the applicant's street work and the City is not responsible, either directly 
or indirectly, for any damage to property or injury to a person, including death, arising 
from the escape, discharge or release of any hazardous substance from its streets.

employees, agents, contractors and invitees to all health and safety laws including any 
regulations requiring installation of safety devices or appliances, and any applicable 
traffic laws or regulations (collectively "safety rules"). If in the opinion of the City the

CHAPTER 743, STREETS AND SIDEWALKS, USE OF 

likelihood of harm to persons or property appears imminent, the City may suspend street 
work performed by or on behalf of the applicant where there appears to be a lack of 
compliance with the safety rules, or because conditions of danger exist that would likely 
result in injury to any person or property. Such suspension shall continue until the lack of 
compliance or danger is eliminated. 

For the purpose of this provision, "hazardous substance" means any hazardous substance 
and includes, but is not limited to, radioactive substances, petroleum products and 
byproducts, industrial wastes, contaminants, pollutants, dangerous substances, and toxic 
substances, as defined in or pursuant to any law, ordinance, rule, regulation, by-law or

including but not limited to any liability for clean-up of any hazardous substance in, on, 
under, along, across and around streets that result from: 

(a) 

(b) 

The operations of the applicant in, on, over, under, along, across or around the 
streets; or 

Any products or goods brought in, on, over, under, along, across or around the 
streets by the applicant, or by any other person with the express or implied 
consent of the applicant. 

The applicant shall in writing, prior to any permit being granted by the General Manager, 
indemnify and save harmless the City, its elected and appointed officials, officers, 
employees, directors and agents from and against all actions, claims, executions, 
demands, damages, liabilities, liens, costs, expenses direct or indirect (including 
reasonable legal fees and disbursements), and losses whatsoever incurred by the City, its 
elected and appointed officials, officers, employees, directors and agents in connection 
with the issuing of the permit, the conduct of the applicant's street work or the use of 
applicant's equipment, including claims in respect of property damage or personal injury, 
including death, and will pay to the City and to each such official, servant or agent on 
demand any loss, costs, damages and expenses, including legal fees and disbursements, 
that may be sustained, incurred or paid by the City or by any of its officers, servants and 
agents in consequence of any such action, claim, lien, execution or demand, including 
any monies paid or payable by the City or any of its officials, officers, servants or agents 
in settlement or discharge or on account thereof, provided that on default of such 
payment all loss, costs, damages and expenses and all such monies so paid or payable 
may be deducted from any security held by the City on account of the permit of the street 
work. 

24. 

The City shall not be liable in any way for indirect or consequential losses or damages, or 
damages for pure economic loss, howsoever caused or contributed to, in connection with 
the applicant's street work.

upon any street work.

or letter of credit in a form satisfactory to the Controller and in an amount which is 
satisfactory to the General Manager to ensure proper compliance with this Chapter. 

The applicant shall at all times during the term of the permit and subsequent to the 
completion of the street work provide an accurate and timely in-house "locate" service or 
be a member of a "locate" service, in which case the applicant shall advise the General 
Manager of its membership in such a service. Should the applicant fail to comply with 
this provision, the City shall not be required to make any special effort to determine or 
confirm the location of the equipment. The applicant shall, at the request of the City or 
any third party, provide or cause to be provided accurate on-site locates within 
14 consecutive days of receiving a request for such information. 

The applicant shall respond within 14 consecutive days to any request from the City for a 
mark-up of municipal infrastructure design drawings showing the location of any portion 
of the equipment located in, on, under, over, across, or along the streets shown on the 
plans, and shall provide such accurate and detailed information as may be required by the 
General Manager.  

29.

drawings or subsequent "as built" drawings and in a state of good order, condition and 
repair, to the full satisfaction of the General Manager, acting reasonably.
