every respect except that it may consist of temporary fencing if authorized by the 
Executive Director or an officer. 

Any authorization to erect temporary fencing is granted on the condition that the 
temporary fencing shall be replaced with a permanent swimming pool enclosure 
that fully complies with this article when an officer directs replacement or when 
construction of the swimming pool is substantially complete, whichever occurs 
first, and in determining whether to direct replacement of temporary fencing, an 
officer shall consider, among other factors, whether construction is proceeding 
expeditiously, whether temporary fencing is being adequately maintained and 
whether safety might be compromised without a permanent enclosure. 

Temporary fencing shall be erected in a good, workmanlike manner and shall 
consist of steel "T" posts spaced at not more than 1.2 metre centres and embedded 
at least 600 millimetres into the ground with 38 millimetre plastic mesh fencing at

confirmed completion of a permanent swimming pool enclosure that fully 
complies with this article. 

Despite Subsection B(7), a person may fill a swimming pool with water when 
temporary fencing has been erected in compliance with this article, but the 
swimming pool shall not be used until permanent fencing has been erected and an 
officer has conducted an inspection and confirmed completion of a permanent
