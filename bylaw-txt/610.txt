Subsection B, a notice will be served on the vehicle owner informing them of the amount 
of the administrative penalty now owing. 

The screening officer may only extend the time to request a review of an administrative 
penalty by a screening officer where a recipient demonstrates, on a balance of 
probabilities, the existence of extenuating circumstances that warrant the extension of 
time. 

Despite anything else to the contrary in § 610-2.2, a screening officer may, where 
exceptional circumstances have been established on the balance of probabilities, extend 
the time to request a review subsequent to the passing of the timeline in Subsection D. 

For purposes of Subsection G, exceptional circumstances means severe circumstances of 
extended durations that would significantly or materially impact an individual's ability to 
exercise procedural rights established under this chapter. 

Where an extension of time to request a review of an administrative penalty is not 
granted by the screening officer, the administrative penalty is deemed to be affirmed. 

A vehicle owner may, up to one time only, request an adjournment of the screening 
review by filing with the City a request for adjournment in the form and manner 
established by the City Solicitor no later than 4:00 p.m. on the day 2 business days in 
advance of the date set for review by the screening officer. 

The screening officer may request such information from a recipient or other individual

recipient or other individual without the need for the attendance of the recipient or other 
individual. 

The screening officer may request, consider and rely on information from an enforcement 
officer, other City/Agency staff, or staff of the Toronto Police Service as the screening 
officer deems relevant, without the need for the attendance of the individual, including 
but not limited to:  a certified statement of an enforcement officer, other documents

individual is necessary to ensure a fair hearing. 

Any decision by a hearing officer is final. 

After a hearing has been held by a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall make a 
hearing decision and serve it upon a recipient. 

Having rendered a decision that included payment of an administrative penalty and/or 
administrative fee, or in the circumstances of Subsection S, the hearing officer may 
consider a request for additional time to pay the administrative penalty and administrative 
fees payable and can only approve such an extension based on the following 
considerations: 

(1) 

the amount of the administrative penalty and administrative fees payable; 

(2) 

undue hardship. 

S. 

If only a request for an extension of time to pay the administrative penalty contained in 
the screening decision has been filed, then: 

(1) 

All recipients are deemed to have waived the right to request a review and have 
consented to a disposition of the amount owing under the screening decision 
without a hearing by the hearing officer; and 

(2) 

The administrative penalty, including any administrative fee, is not subject to any 
further review or appeal. 

T. 

Where a recipient fails to attend at the time and place scheduled for a review by the 
hearing officer: 

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

All recipients shall be deemed to have abandoned the request for a review of the 
screening decision and have consented to a disposition of the amount owing under 
the screening decision without a hearing by the hearing officer; 

The screening decision and the administrative penalty shall be deemed to be final 
and are not subject to any further review or appeal; 

The administrative penalty is deemed to be affirmed on the screening decision 
issuance date; and 

The vehicle owner shall, with the exception of cancellation under Subsection I, 
pay to the City a hearing non-appearance fee in the amount set out in Schedule B. 

U.  Where an administrative penalty is deemed to be affirmed under Subsection T, the 
hearing officer shall, without a hearing as permitted by section 4.1 of the Statutory 
Powers and Procedures Act, affirm the screening decision.  A hearing decision affirming

the screening decision and establishing the liability to pay to the City a hearing non-
appearance fee shall be served upon the vehicle owner. 

§ 610-2.4. Excusal from administrative penalty and administrative fees. 

A.  Where a recipient wishes to assert undue hardship as a basis to be excused from paying 
all or part of the administrative penalty, including any administrative fees, the recipient 
must complete the applicable form and attach, if applicable, evidence of undue hardship.  
Examples of evidence relevant to the financial hardship category of undue hardship 
include, but are not limited to: 

(1) 

Old Age Security; 

(2) 

Canada Pension, CRA tax assessment information; 

(3) 

Guaranteed Income Supplement; 

(4) 

Disability Pension; 

(5) 

Ontario Student Assistance Program;  and 

(6) 

Any other form of social assistance. 

B. 

The screening officer or the hearing officer: 

(1) 

(2) 

may excuse a vehicle owner from paying all or part of the administrative penalty, 
including any administrative fees, in accordance with the policies, practices and 
procedures approved by the City Solicitor, Treasurer and Director of Court 
Services, that may cause undue hardship; and 

will satisfy themselves at the screening review or hearing review as to the 
authenticity/credibility of the oral or documentary evidence and will refer to that 
evidence in their decision.

Enforcement and Service 

§ 610-3.1. Enforcement. 

A.  Where a screening review or a hearing review, an extension of time for such a review, or 

an extension of time to pay, has been filed, the timelines as set out in Subsections E, F 
and G and §§ 610-4.1A, B and C of this chapter are suspended until the decision is issued

C. 

D. 

E. 

F. 

Despite Subsection A, where an extension of time to pay the administrative penalty is 
granted pursuant to this chapter, enforcement mechanisms will be suspended until after 
the extension of time has expired. 

An administrative penalty, including any administrative fees, that is affirmed or reduced 
in respect of which the time for payment has been extended is due and payable and 
constitutes a debt to the City owed by the vehicle owner. 

Where an administrative penalty is not paid within 60 calendar days after it becomes due 
and payable to the City, the City Solicitor may notify the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in 
the jurisdiction where the permit (vehicle licence plate) is registered of the default. 

Where any amount owed to the City under this chapter has not been paid within 15 days 
after the date that it becomes due and payable to the City, the City Solicitor may have a 
certificate of default filed with a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with 
section 9 of O.Reg. 611/06, pursue civil enforcement of any certificate of default so filed, 
initiate any other court action to collect the outstanding amount, may appeal any decision 
where warranted, may discontinue or settle such claim or action where it is concluded by 
the City Solicitor that it is reasonable to do so and may execute any documents as 
required to discontinue or settle the claim or action. 

G.  Where any amount owed to the City under this chapter has not been paid within 15 days 
after the date that it becomes due and payable to the City, the City Solicitor may pursue 
any other enforcement measures permitted under section 11 of O.Reg. 611/06, including, 
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the placement of debts with collection 
agencies in good standing under the Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act; and 
where the City Solicitor places a debt with collection agencies in good standing under the 
Collection and Debt Settlement Services Act, the collection agency may also recover its 
reasonable costs of collecting the debt, as approved by the City. 

§ 610-3.2. Service of documents. 

A. 

Service of any document or notice, including but not limited to a penalty notice, may be 
made:

where an agreement to share this information is in place. 

D.

hearing decision is handed, shall be deemed to be service on the vehicle owner. 

ARTICLE 4 
Administrative fees 

§ 610-4.1 Administrative fees. 

A.  Where an administrative penalty and all administrative fees are not paid within 

30 calendar days after the date that an administrative penalty and any administrative fees 
become due and payable to the City, the vehicle owner shall pay to the City a late 
payment fee in the amount set out in Schedule B. 

B.  Where an administrative penalty is not paid within 15 calendar days after it becomes due 

and payable to the City, the vehicle owner shall pay to the City a vehicle owner/address 
search fee in the amount set out in Schedule B. 

C.  Where an administrative penalty and all administrative fees are not paid within 60 

calendar days after an administrative penalty and any administrative fees become due and 
payable to the City and the City notifies the Registrar of Motor Vehicles in the 
jurisdiction where the permit is registered of the default, the vehicle owner shall then pay 
to the City a plate denial enforcement fee in the amount set out in Schedule B. 

D.  Where a recipient provides a cheque or other demand for payment to the City for 

payment of any administrative penalty or administrative fee and there are insufficient 
funds available in the account on which the instrument was drawn, the recipient shall pay 
to the City a non-sufficient fund (NSF) fee in the amount set out in Schedule B.

administrative fee and a fee reversal of the credit charge has taken place, the 
administrative penalty and any administrative fees are deemed to not have been paid and 
any or any additional administrative fees will be applied in accordance with this chapter. 

Where an administrative penalty is cancelled by a screening officer or a hearing officer, 
any associated administrative fee is also cancelled. 

If a person has paid any administrative fee in Schedule B in respect of an administrative 
penalty and the administrative penalty is subsequently cancelled by a screening officer or 
a hearing officer, the City shall refund the administrative fee paid in full to the person 
who paid the administrative fee. 

H.  Where a refund of a payment is made under this chapter for any reason, the refunded
