requirements for the construction and maintenance of green roofs.  The design and 
construction of a green roof shall meet the City's minimum requirements for green roof 
construction while also meeting the Ontario Building Code (OBC) requirements. The 
Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard does not replace or alter any existing OBC

CHAPTER 492, GREEN ROOFS 

C. 

This article is considered an acceptable solution for the design and construction of a 
green roof in addition to the acceptable solutions contained in parts 3 to 12, Division B, 
of the OBC.  Designs shall meet the OBC objectives to demonstrate compliance with the 
OBC; however a design that complies with the provisions of § 492-9 shall be deemed to 
comply to such objectives. 

D. 

A green roof designed to the Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard may be 
constructed on both combustible and non-combustible buildings. 

§ 492-9. Toronto Green Roof Construction Standard: mandatory provisions. 

The following standards shall be met in the design and construction of a green roof: 

A. 

Green roof assembly. 

A green roof assembly shall, as a minimum, consist of a root repellent system, a drainage 
system, a filtering layer, a growing medium and plants, and shall be installed on a 
waterproof membrane of an applicable roof. 

B.

provided by the ASTM standard: "ASTM E2397.05 - Standard Practice for 
Determination of Dead Loads and Live Loads Associated with Green Roof 
Systems." 

(2) 

The density of the growing media shall be determined: 

(a) 

In accordance with "ASTM E2399.05 - Standard Test Method for 
Maximum Media Density for Dead Load Analysis of Green Roof 
Systems"; or alternatively 

(b) 

The designer may use an un-factored, saturated density of the growing 
media of 2,000 kg/m3. 

(3) 

The applicant shall include design loads definition as part of the "Green Roof 
Declaration" form which shall be required as part of an application for building 
permit. 

C. 

Slope stability. 

All roofs with slopes in excess of 10º (17 percent) that support green roof assemblies 
shall incorporate anti-shear measures. 

D. 

Parapet height and/or overflow scupper locations.

TORONTO MUNICIPAL CODE 
CHAPTER 492, GREEN ROOFS 

(1) 

Parapets and scuppers shall be specified in the design, as required, to limit 
retained rain water loads to within structural limits in the event of obstructed 
internal drains. 

(2) 

Analysis shall be done in conformance with OBC Division B 4.1.6.4.(4).(3). 

(3) 

The referenced point for the overflow scuppers height must be clearly indicated to 
avoid the possibility of confusing the overflow scupper height as being measured 
above the finished green surface or other layer above the waterproofing resulting 
in higher water load than accounted for by the design as indicated in the sketch 
below. 

E.  Wind uplift. 

The applicant shall provide a report, stamped by an engineer, providing wind uplift 
pressures being designed for (including a description of how the pressures were 
determined), and describing how the design addresses these pressures. 

F. 

Fire safety. 

Where roof penetrations, intersecting walls, parapets, upturns or mechanical equipment are 
clad with combustible materials the design shall include a vegetation-free border zone 
abutting such features and the vegetation-free border shall be equal to the vegetation height 
at maturity but in no case be less than 0.5 metres. 

G.  Occupancy and safety. 

The applicant shall state, in a green roof declaration form and the green roof application, 
the use of the roof and whether or not it will be accessible to the public.

I. 

Drainage. 

(1) 

(2) 

The design hydraulic load shall be evaluated assuming that the green roof system 
is fully saturated prior to the maximum fifteen-minute rainfall. 

Positive slope to drain shall be provided at the level of the waterproofing 
membrane. 

(3) 

The system shall permit effective drainage beneath the growth media. 

(4) 

Vegetation-free zones shall be provided around all drains. 

J. 

Water retention.  

(1)  Water retention mats or equivalent materials shall be employed as required to 

promote vegetation growth. 

(2)

(3) 

Vegetation on a green roof shall not include any noxious weeds as defined in 
Ontario Regulation 1096 under the Weed Control Act, as may be amended from 
time to time. 

The plant selection and design shall be such that within three years of the planting 
date the selected plants shall cover no less than 80 percent of the vegetated roof. 

Compliance with the plant coverage required in the preceding sentence can be 
satisfied by a design that will provide one or more of the following: 

(a) 

That seeds for groundcover plantings shall be sown at a rate not less than 
325/m2; 

(b)  That cuttings shall be distributed not less than 12kg/100m2; and 

(c) 

Either that pre-grown plugs shall be installed not less than 11/m2 or a
