H.  Wait lists. 

(1)  Where there are insufficient permit parking spaces on a road designated in 

Schedule A which is not in a permit parking area, or in a permit parking area, to 
accommodate all of the otherwise valid applications, the General Manager shall 
establish a wait list in respect of each such road or permit parking area. Each wait 
list shall set out the valid applications in each of priorities 1, 2 and 3 and shall 
rank them in order based on the date of the application, from the earliest to the 
most recent. 

(2)  Where a permit parking space becomes available during a permit parking term, 

the General Manager shall notify the applicant at the top of the priority 1 wait list 
for the road or permit parking area, as the case may be, of the availability of the 
space. The applicant shall have 21 days to claim the space, pay the appropriate fee 
and have a permit issued. If the notified applicant fails to claim the space or pay 
the fee, the General Manager shall notify the next highest ranked person on the 
wait list, and shall continue to do so until a permit is issued in respect of the 
available space. 

(3) 

If no priority 1 applicant claims the space, the General Manager shall offer it to 
the highest ranking applicant on the priority 2 list. The applicant shall have 21

days to claim the space, pay the appropriate fee and have a permit issued. If the 
notified applicant fails to claim the space or pay the fee, the General Manager 
shall notify the next highest ranked person on the wait list, and shall continue to 
do so until a permit is issued in respect of the available space. 

(4) 

If no priority 2 applicant claims the space, the General Manager shall offer it to 
the highest ranking applicant on the priority 3 list. The applicant shall have 21 
days to claim the space, pay the appropriate fee and have a permit issued. If the 
notified applicant fails to claim the space or pay the fee, the General Manager 
shall notify the next highest ranked person on the wait list, and shall continue to 
do so until a permit is issued in respect of the available space or until there are no 
more applicants on a wait list. 

(5) 

Any applicant who is offered a space and either declines, fails to claim the space 
in the time required, or fails to pay the fee shall have their name deleted from the 
wait list.

If there is a wait list in respect of priority 1 applications and priority 3 or priority 
2 permits have been issued, the General Manager shall determine how many 
spaces that are currently assigned to priority 3 and priority 2 applications are 
needed to accommodate those on the priority 1 wait list. The General Manager 
shall notify a sufficient number of priority 3 and priority 2 permit holders, in the 
order set out below, that their permits will be cancelled and their fees will be 
refunded, and the General Manager shall make those spaces available to those on 
the priority 1 wait list. 

Under § 925-5I(2), the General Manager shall, in order to accommodate those on 
the priority 1 wait list, first notify those priority 3 permit holders whose permits 
were issued most recently, and continue to so notify priority 3 permit holders 
continuing with the next most recently issued permits until sufficient spaces for 
those on the priority 1 wait list have been made available. 

If there are insufficient priority 3 permit holders to accommodate all of those 
applicants on the priority 1 wait list, the General Manager shall notify, under 
§ 925-5I(2), those priority 2 permit holders whose permits were issued most 
recently, and continue to so notify priority 2 permit holders continuing with the 
next most recently issued permits. 

If, after having cancelled all priority 3 and 2 permits there remain applicants on 
the priority 1 wait list, then the wait list shall be maintained for the next permit 
parking term.
