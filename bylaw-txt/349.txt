determine that the dog is not a dangerous dog and may determine that no order to 
comply shall be issued.

not to issue an order to comply under Subsection C(2), that dangerous act will not

In deciding whether to confirm or rescind the determination of a dangerous dog pursuant 
to Subsection A, the Dangerous Dog Review Tribunal may consider whether the dog was 
acting in self-defence when the dangerous act leading to the order to comply under § 349-
15 occurred.

Tribunal within 30 days after a copy of an order to comply pursuant to § 349-15 is served 
on the owner, notice in writing requesting the hearing, accompanied by the applicable fee 
in the amount specified in Chapter 441, Fees and Charges. 

Although a request for hearing may be requested, an order to comply pursuant to § 349-

comply is served on the person to whom it is directed.
