An industry or subject sector industry which discharges a subject pollutant not contained 
in its approved plan shall update its plan within 90 days of the discharge of the additional 
subject pollutant to include it unless expressly provided otherwise in this section. This

Subject to Section 681-6A(7), the industrial waste surcharge fee in an industrial 
waste surcharge agreement shall be calculated in accordance with the formula set 
out in Table 4 below [Added 2019-03-28 by By-law 515-201912]: 

Table 4 - Surcharge Fee Calculation Formula 

The formula is based on the cost to treat a unit (kg) of the surchargeable 
parameters and is applied to additional units (kg) of all parameters discharged 
above the applicable Chapter 681 parameter limits allowing full cost recovery for 
the wastewater treatment services provided by the City. However, the surcharge 
fees for any additional parameters beyond the parameter that exceeds the 
applicable Chapter 681 parameter limit the most shall be phased in over a six year 
period using an annual adjustment factor as set out herein. Subject to 
Section 681-6A(7), the total industrial waste surcharge fee payable 
(SurchargeTOTAL) shall be calculated as follows: 

1. 

From April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.16] 

2. 

From April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.30] 

3. 

From April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.44] 

4. 

From April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.58] 

5. 

From April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.72] 

6. 

From April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeHE + [(SurchargeF – SurchargeHE) x 0.86]

Effective on or after April 1, 2025: 

SurchargeTOTAL = SurchargeF 

Where SurchargeHE (Surcharge Fee Based on the Highest Excess) is 
calculated using the parameter that exceeds the applicable Chapter 681 parameter 
limits the most as follows: 

SurchargeHE = CHE x Volume (m3) x R ($/kg)  

1000 

CHE = (actual average concentration, mg/L - By-law Parameter Limit, mg/L) for 
the parameter that exceeds the applicable Chapter 681, Sewers, parameter the 
most 

actual average concentration = the City measured average concentration in the 
effluent of the discharger, mg/L 

By-law Parameter Limit = Chapter 681 parameter limit, mg/L [see Table 1 of 
Chapter 681 and Section 681-6B(1)] 

R = unit cost per kilogram of parameter being treated, $/kg, as established under 
Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, Appendix D - Schedule 3, Wastewater Services, 
from time to time 

Volume = annual volume discharged in m3 divided quarterly for the invoice 
period. 

And where SurchargeF (Surcharge Fee Based on Full Cost Recovery for All 
Parameters) is calculated using all parameters discharged above the applicable 
Chapter 681 parameter limits as follows: 

SurchargeF = [(CBOD x RBOD) + (CTSS x RTSS) + (CTP x RTP) + (CTKN x 
RTKN) + (CPHE x RPHE)] x Volume (m3)

C = (actual average concentration, mg/L – By-law Parameter Limit, mg/L)
