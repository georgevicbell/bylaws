CHAPTER 841, WASTE COLLECTION, COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES 

C.  When the owner of a RUAC property who receives curbside collection requests a garbage 

cart exchange under § 841-10.1M, requests an additional garbage cart, or when there is a 
change in ownership of a residential property, the curbside collection fees under Subsection 
A will be prorated on a daily basis. 

D.  Despite Subsection A, if an owner of a RUAC property who receives curbside collection 

uses a specialized in-home compactor to reduce its garbage volume and, as a result, uses a 
smaller-sized garbage cart, the General Manager reserves the right to increase the curbside 
collection fees for the RUAC property to a larger-sized garbage cart to compensate for the 
compaction, as the curbside collection fees are based on the collection of un-compacted 
garbage.

curbside collection fee on the utility bill issued pursuant to Article III of Chapter 849,

frequency as set out in § 849-30 of Chapter 849, Water and Sewage Services and Utility 
Bill, to reflect the appropriate portion of a full-year rebate amount. 

C. 

If the rebate in Subsection A represents a credit on the utility bill as set out in Article III of 
Chapter 849, Water and Sewer Services and Utility Bill, the credit shall be applied to any 
applicable fees related to water and sewage services that appear on the utility bill in
